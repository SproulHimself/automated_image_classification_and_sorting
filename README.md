# Automated Photograph Culling

I am not a photographer, nor am I passionate about photography. But my current roommate is a passionate photographer. When she gets home from shoots, she has between 1000 to 2000 photos which she has to sort though manually. For my latest project I wanted to attempt to use machine and deep learning techniques to build something that could save her time during the culling process.
