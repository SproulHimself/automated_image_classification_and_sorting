# Automated Photograph Culling

### Abstract

This is my capstone project for Flatiron School.  I built two image classification models using convolutional neural networks, achieving accuracy scores of 91.5% and 88.5%. The models were combined into an application, currently in beta version.


### Motivation

I am not a photographer, nor am I passionate about photography. But my current roommate is a passionate photographer who runs her own business. When she gets home from shoots, she has between 1000 to 2000 photos which she has to sort though manually. For my latest project I wanted to attempt to use deep learning techniques and python to build something that could save her time during the culling process.

#### Question?
* Can I use deep learning to classify photos based on specific features?

#### Goals:
* Identify photos that are blurry
* Identify photos that contain people blinking
* Build a platform that automatically sorts photos for photographers to save time during the culling process




### Next steps

* Identify duplicate/similar photos
* Further develop the application
